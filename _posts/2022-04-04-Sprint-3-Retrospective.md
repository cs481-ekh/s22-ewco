### Sprint Goal:
- [x] Complete MVP to work on stretch goals during Sprint 4
> We achieved our goal.

### Capacity /Velocity
Our team was working at great pace this sprint, so we intend to continue in the same way with Sprint 4.

### Unforeseen technical issues
We had some technical issues with our Rust API. The fact out API has to be in Rust has MASSIVELY complicated this project.
We ran into CORS issues when implementing the CRUD buttons on the front-end, and it turned out to be an issue with the API, that was completely unrelated to CORS.

### Tasks Completed:
All tasks were completed
- [x] Pagination for task table.
- [x] Add REST API endpoint for querying system resource usage metrics.
- [x] Create Rust module for monitoring system.
