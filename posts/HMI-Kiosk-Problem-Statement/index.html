To keep the cost down, we need to be able to use fairly simple hardware, while still offering state of the art UIs. Oftentimes, these systems are air gapped from the internet, and so installations must be fast and simple. Upgrades may happen over USB or SSH from a directly connected laptop, again without internet; there can be no reliance on package or source code repositories. The HMIs serve a backend system that may run on the same hardware. This brings the requirement for a (relational) database and a webserver process to serve the frontend. Our preference for the frontend is Vue.js, but other options can be explored, especially if performance is improved without compromising quality. Using a full desktop Linux such as Ubuntu or Manjaro brings in more than the small hardware footprint can handle. Using backend languages like Node and Python cause upgrade and versioning nightmares, while posing an IP security problem when code is in plaintext on the device.</p><h2 id="desired-solution"><span class="mr-2">Desired Solution</span><a href="#desired-solution" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2></h2><p>Go West would like to have a proof of concept for a lightweight OS and webserver running on small footprint hardware; a Celeron CPU with 1GB RAM. This should be enough to run a FireFox browser in kiosk mode, without installing a desktop environment. For the OS we would like to use FreeBSD and a frontend written in Vue.js. The backend webserver runs on the same machine and is written in Rust; we recommend ‘Warp’. It should communicate with a PostgreSQL Database using the Diesel library.</p><h3 id="resources"><span class="mr-2">Resources:</span><a href="#resources" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3></h3><ul><li><strong>Rust Diesel:</strong><ul><li>https://diesel.rs/guides/getting-started</ul><li><strong>Warp web server framework:</strong><ul><li>https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp</ul><li><strong>FireFox Kiosk Mode:</strong><ul><li>https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-enterprise-kiosk-mode</ul><li><strong>Running FireFox without a desktop:</strong><ul><li>https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-run-x-applications-without-a-desktop-or-a-wm</ul></ul><h2 id="frontend-requirements"><span class="mr-2">Frontend requirements</span><a href="#frontend-requirements" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2></h2><p>The frontend requirements are simple for this proof of concept, but must display the capabilities of the full system. There will be 3 views:</p><ul><li><strong>System diagnostics</strong><ul><li>Disk capacity<li>Cpu usage<li>Last reboot, boot time.<li>IP address<li>Etc. interesting system stats</ul><li><strong>System Maintenance</strong> This is the screen used for system maintenance:<ul><li><strong>Upgrades.</strong> Allow upload of an update file from a USB stick to update the Rust and Vue code<li><strong>Reboot.</strong> A button to reboot the system. It should come back up in the application. It would be great if it could record the time it took from pressing this button to being fully rebooted, store that in the db for display in the diagnostics screen. Shoot for &lt; 10s<li><strong>Reset database.</strong> A button to remove all user data from the database, essentially a factory reset.</ul><li><strong>Data and operations</strong> This varies from application to application so this can be something creative. The requirements are simply to be showing values read from the database, and some mechanism to change and add those values. A suggestion is some ability to schedule a ‘task’, have the system update and display its progress and display the list of completed tasks. Anything else that reads/writes the database is acceptable.</ul><p>Because we want to demonstrate the performance of the UI on this platform, it is advisable to use some more complex elements; animation in the form of donut charts or a sliding navigation panel. There is however no need for things like video playback or webgl.</p><h2 id="installation-and-upgrade-requirements"><span class="mr-2">Installation and upgrade requirements</span><a href="#installation-and-upgrade-requirements" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2></h2><p>The initial provisioning of the system can be manual, meaning that all components are installed with a network connection step by step, not via an installer script or other automated mechanism. Once provisioned though, the system should be upgradable via its own interface (see the System Maintenance page above). This process should be done by an untrained user, someone with no familiarity with Linux or programming, and may not know what a file-path is. There should be a documented method of creating a USB stick (by technical personnel) that can be provided to the user. The user should be able to insert this USB stick, press the upgrade button on the maintenance screen and somehow end up with an upgraded system. The version number should be visible on all screens.</p><p>For this project, the upgrade does not have to handle database migrations (additions or modifications to the PostgreSQL db), but it should be able to update the Vue.js code as well as the Rust code. As a stretch goal, the system should be robust to old or garbage update files or even maliciously crafted ones.</p></div><div class="post-tail-wrapper text-muted"><div class="post-meta mb-3"> <i class="far fa-folder-open fa-fw mr-1"></i> <a href='/s22-ewco/categories/gowest-robotics/'>GoWest Robotics</a>, <a href='/s22-ewco/categories/documents/'>Documents</a></div><div class="post-tags"> <i class="fa fa-tags fa-fw mr-1"></i> <a href="/s22-ewco/tags/documents/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >documents</a> <a href="/s22-ewco/tags/problem/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >problem</a> <a href="/s22-ewco/tags/statement/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >statement</a></div><div class="post-tail-bottom d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center mt-3 pt-5 pb-2"><div class="license-wrapper"> This post is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"> CC BY 4.0 </a> by the author.</div><div class="share-wrapper"> <span class="share-label text-muted mr-1">Share</span> <span class="share-icons"> <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=FreeBSD Industrial HMI Kiosk - EWCO Team&amp;url=https://cs481-ekh.github.io/s22-ewco//s22-ewco/posts/HMI-Kiosk-Problem-Statement/" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Twitter"> <i class="fa-fw fab fa-twitter"></i> </a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?title=FreeBSD Industrial HMI Kiosk - EWCO Team&amp;u=https://cs481-ekh.github.io/s22-ewco//s22-ewco/posts/HMI-Kiosk-Problem-Statement/" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Facebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Facebook"> <i class="fa-fw fab fa-facebook-square"></i> </a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https://cs481-ekh.github.io/s22-ewco//s22-ewco/posts/HMI-Kiosk-Problem-Statement/" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Linkedin" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Linkedin"> <i class="fa-fw fab fa-linkedin"></i> </a> <i id="copy-link" class="fa-fw fas fa-link small" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Copy link" data-title-succeed="Link copied successfully!"> </i> </span></div></div></div></div></div><div id="panel-wrapper" class="col-xl-3 pl-2 text-muted"><div class="access"><div id="access-lastmod" class="post"><div class="panel-heading">Recent Update</div><ul class="post-content pl-0 pb-1 ml-1 mt-2"><li><a href="/s22-ewco/posts/Project-Handoff/">Project Handoff</a><li><a href="/s22-ewco/posts/GoWestRobotics-Documentation/">GWR Documentation Deliverables</a><li><a href="/s22-ewco/posts/FreeBSD-Set-up/">Running WebApp on FreeBSD</a><li><a href="/s22-ewco/posts/Ubuntu-Set-up/">Running WebApp on Ubuntu</a><li><a href="/s22-ewco/posts/FreeBSD-Research/">FreeBSD Research</a></ul></div><div id="access-tags"><div class="panel-heading">Trending Tags</div><div class="d-flex flex-wrap mt-3 mb-1 mr-3"> <a class="post-tag" href="/s22-ewco/tags/meeting/">meeting</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/s22-ewco/tags/minutes/">minutes</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/s22-ewco/tags/sprint-planning/">sprint planning</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/s22-ewco/tags/freebsd/">freebsd</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/s22-ewco/tags/sponsor/">sponsor</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/s22-ewco/tags/usage/">usage</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/s22-ewco/tags/documentation/">documentation</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/s22-ewco/tags/documents/">documents</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/s22-ewco/tags/gwr/">gwr</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/s22-ewco/tags/handoff/">handoff</a></div></div></div><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/afeld/bootstrap-toc@1.0.1/dist/bootstrap-toc.min.js"></script><div id="toc-wrapper" class="pl-0 pr-4 mb-5"><div class="panel-heading pl-3 pt-2 mb-2">Contents</div><nav id="toc" data-toggle="toc"></nav></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-12 col-lg-11 col-xl-8"><div id="tail-wrapper" class="pl-1 pr-1 pl-sm-2 pr-sm-2 pl-md-4 pr-md-4"><div id="related-posts" class="mt-5 mb-2 mb-sm-4"><h3 class="pt-2 mt-1 mb-4 ml-1" data-toc-skip>Further Reading</h3><div class="card-deck mb-4"><div class="card"> <a href="/s22-ewco/posts/GoWestRobotics-Documentation/"><div class="card-body"> <em class="timeago small" data-ts="1650549600" > 2022-04-21 </em><h3 class="pt-0 mt-1 mb-3" data-toc-skip>GWR Documentation Deliverables</h3><div class="text-muted small"><p> Status The basic desired functionality of the project is all up and running, the CRUD operations all work properly and the system logs are all stored on a centralized log file on the device.
